# Homework 4

## Problem 1
- **Language Theory:** It deals with the expression of computation and information, analyzing how alphabets can compute functions.
- **Automata Theory:** It analyzes specific, formal models of computers, including things like the turing machine, pascal's adder, and more.
- **Computability Theory:** It is the discussion of whether or not every possible function can be computed, the answer being "no"; specificially, a function that knows if a given program will terminate.
- **Complexity Theory:** Complexity theory is similar to computability theory, but specifically with reguard to how long a function will take to compute.
